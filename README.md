# Data Structures implementations 

Implementation of common ds (data structures).
This project aims to help solve other projects using these ds.
## Goals:
1. Try to make it generic  (when possible).
2. Try to make a good perfomance ds (nothing crazy).

## How it works:
1. Each language it's in it's own folder e.g. C++ is in cpp, c is in c.
2. Inside the language's folder, you will find the ds implementation, for example
single linked list is in the folder "sllist".
